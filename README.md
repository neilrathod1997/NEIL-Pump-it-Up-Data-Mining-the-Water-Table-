<h2>
Pump it up data mining the water table
</h2>

Based on data published by the Tanzanian Ministry of Water and Taarifa, Our objective is to predict the status of Tanzanian water pumps. The water pumps are either functional, non-functional, or they are functional but need repair. We are given 40 predictor variables providing information on the location, management, and extraction method of the pump when it was installed, and how it is managed.

Drivendata has begun a competition 'Pump It Up' to point out this problem. With the predictive model, people can understand which water points are functional, non-functional, and functional but needs to be repaired. This model can help the Tanzanian government to find likely maintenance needy wells or give useful information for future wells.Click [here](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/) to visit the competition page.

This repo contains my EDA, data cleaning, feature engineering, modelling work and deployment work for this DrivenData competition, where I currently hold a top 4% score (0.8234). You can also find some additional experiments I performed for a set of [Medium articles]() that I wrote about this competition.
